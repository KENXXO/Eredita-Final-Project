# Eredità

The following code is for our front end demonstration of Eredità, which was created in Python through a library called Streamlit. In order to run, you must download the files and launch the file through your console and the website will deploy. But worry not, the website is live and can be accessed through https://ereditalegacy.streamlit.app/
